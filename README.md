# Todo list with user authentication on React.js

Made this project for me to better learn React.js and the Flux pattern.

Project is built on node.js/express with passport modules on the back end, and React.js/Flux on the front end.

## Running the project

1. Install node.js and npm
2. ```$ git clone https://github.com/ednunezg/oauth-example```
3. Install dependencies ```$ npm install```
4. Use the Google and Facebook developer pages to create a new app to be used for OAuth 2 authorization.
6. Rename "app-config-SAMPLE.js" to "app-config.js" and insert your Facebook and Google app id and secret.
7. Start app ```$ npm run start:dev```
8. Go to http://localhost:3000
