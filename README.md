# react-todolist
Simple web application for todo-list management. Features OAuth 2. Made this as a dummy project for me to learn React.js 

# Todo list with user authentication on React.js

Made this project for me to better learn React.js and the Flux pattern.

Project is built on node.js/express with passport modules on the back end, and React.js/Flux on the front end.

Running the project

Install node.js and npm
$ git clone https://github.com/ednunezg/react-todolist
Install dependencies $ npm install
Use the Google and Facebook developer pages to create a new app to be used for OAuth 2 authorization.
Rename "app-config-SAMPLE.js" to "app-config.js" and insert your Facebook and Google app id and secret.
Start app $ nodemon app
Go to http://localhost:3000
